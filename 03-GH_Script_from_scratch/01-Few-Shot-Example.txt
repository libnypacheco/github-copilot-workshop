I have a list of numbers

a = 3, 2, 1, 6, 10

I want a new list b with this result:

b = 3, 5, 6, 12, 22

How can I do that in Python?

ANSWER:
a = [3, 2, 1, 6, 10]
b = []

running_total = 0
for num in a:
    running_total += num
    b.append(running_total)

print(b)

Can you format this script so that I can use it in the Script Editor in Grasshopper3D?

ANSWER:

import ghpythonlib.components as ghcomp

# Input: a (List of numbers)
a = [3, 2, 1, 6, 10]

# Initialize the output list
b = []

# Calculate the running total
running_total = 0
for num in a:
    running_total += num
    b.append(running_total)

# Output: b (List of running totals)
b

Can you do the same for a Dynamo (Revit)?

# Input: IN[0] (List of numbers)
a = IN[0]

# Initialize the output list
b = []

# Calculate the running total
running_total = 0
for num in a:
    running_total += num
    b.append(running_total)

# Output: OUT (List of running totals)
OUT = b
