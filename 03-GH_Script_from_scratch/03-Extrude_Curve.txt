I am in Grasshopper3D, I will provide a curve and I want to extrude that and scale it by a factor of 2; and I want to output that as a polysurface.

Can you provide the python code?

import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

def extrude_and_scale_curve(curve, height, scale_factor):
    # Extrude the curve
    start_point = rs.CurveStartPoint(curve)
    end_point = rs.PointAdd(start_point, (0, 0, height))
    extrusion = rs.ExtrudeCurveStraight(curve, start_point, end_point)
    
    # Scale the extrusion
    centroid = rs.SurfaceAreaCentroid(extrusion)[0]
    scaled_extrusion = rs.ScaleObject(extrusion, centroid, (scale_factor, scale_factor, scale_factor))
    
    # Convert to polysurface
    polysurface = rs.coercebrep(scaled_extrusion)
    
    return polysurface

# Example usage
curve = rs.GetObject("Select a curve to extrude", rs.filter.curve)
if curve:
    height = 10  # Example height for extrusion
    scale_factor = 2  # Scale factor
    polysurface = extrude_and_scale_curve(curve, height, scale_factor)
    if polysurface:
        rs.SelectObject(polysurface)
